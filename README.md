Developed a predictive model for San Francisco house prices using regression analysis. The project involved data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering. I performed exploratory data analysis to identify key variables impacting prices. Then, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, applied a regression model, and fine-tuned it through cross-validation. The model was evaluated for accuracy, and the final predictions were used to make informed real estate decisions, showcasing my proficiency in data analysis and predictive modeling.Developed a predictive model for San Francisco house prices using regression analysis.
